# presumes that RAPL counters are readable

# sudo expose-intel-rapl
# which may work only in certain MMU labs
# set variable for file name of RAPL counter
# NB location of RAPL counters may be system specific

# save initial RAPL counter value

# run command $1 and all its args
$@
# save final RAPL counter value
finish=`cat $ENERGYFILE`
# calc energy consumed
let uj=finish-start
